            <h2 id="who-i-am">Who I Am</h2>
<p>Hello, I'm Astra, a Systems Engineer based in Austin, TX, driven by a profound passion for computer engineering and complex systems architecture. I thrive on solving challenging problems and approaching solutions with innovative, first-principles thinking and a commitment to minimalism over unnecessary complexity.</p>
<h2 id="my-professional-journey">My Professional Journey</h2>
<p>My journey into technology began early; at 17, I joined the Army National Guard as a 68W Combat Medic, where I honed discipline, adaptability, and problem-solving skills under pressure. Transitioning to civilian life in late 2019, I launched my professional career in electronics and technology in Seattle, gaining hands-on experience with diverse hardware systems and operational procedures. In 2021, seeking new opportunities post-COVID, I moved to Austin, TX, where I quickly advanced to a Lead Hardware Technician role. This led to my transition to Tesla Motors, a pivotal experience where I immersed myself in rapid innovation, high-pressure environments, and the practical application of engineering from first principles, embracing the philosophy of &quot;the best part is no part&quot; in manufacturing. This foundation propelled me into the realm of systems engineering, where I continuously expand my wide array of skills, always learning and tackling new challenges.</p>
<h2 id="technical-philosophy-inspirations">Technical Philosophy &amp; Inspirations</h2>
<p>My approach to engineering is rooted in reasoning from first principles, favoring elegant, minimal solutions, and building robust systems from the ground up rather than relying heavily on external dependencies. I am drawn to deep, low-level problems that many shy away from. My inspirations include figures like Casey Muratori, Kernighan and Ritchie, George Hotz, Jonathan Blow, The Primeagean, and John Carmack, whose work embodies the principles of clarity, efficiency, and fundamental understanding.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-the-code">Beyond the Code</h2>
<p>When I'm not immersed in programming or electronics, I enjoy the outdoors through hunting and fishing. I also have a passion for off-road vehicles, particularly Jeeps, Rock Crawlers, and Trail vehicles, and enjoy working on projects outside of software. For relaxation, I like playing video games, watching shows and movies, and spending quality time with my animals and partner. My favorite animes are &quot;Spy x Family&quot;, &quot;Konosuba&quot;, &quot;Tsukamichi&quot; and &quot;Demon Slayer&quot;</p>
